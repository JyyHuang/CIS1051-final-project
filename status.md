#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far, I have basically finished my project. I have created my discord bot and implemented all of the commands that I first set out to do. These are the following commands: play command with a queue, join, leave, pause, skip, stop, and list.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

One thing that I have not done yet is host my bot on an external computer so that it can run 24/7.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have not encountered any problems.
