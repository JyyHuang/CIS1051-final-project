# Discord music bot with commands: join, leave, play, pause, stop, skip, and list.
# I used this tutorial to help me grasp the discord module and write code: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-7Dfw57ZZVRB4N7VWPjmT0Q-2FIMNBMP


# My play command is usable with both urls and youtube search. It also acts like a queue.
# I enjoyed coding this command the most, since it is the main part of my program. It also took the most time since I wanted it to have everything.

# Some difficulties that I faced where trying to get both urls and youtube search to work, adding songs to a queue, and having the bot only message the chat that the user typed in. I got both urls and youtube search to work by using a try-except statement. Adding a queue was tricky, but I figured out that I could use a dictionary to store the songs and titles and popping them through a function. I also used a dictionary for the chat problem by storing the channel. I learned how to use dictionaries better, work with async functions, and about classes.
