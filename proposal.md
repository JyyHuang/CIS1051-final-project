# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

JoyBot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Discord Bot that plays music.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My bot will be able to play music in Discord server's when asked to. It will have some commands that the user can control the bot with. I plan to implement commands such as play, pause, stop, skip, queue, and list. To execute this, I believe that I will have to implement a queue algorithm and use either Spotify or Youtube's API. For the commands, there will be functions that can be accessed when the user types something into a server chat. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be a working bot that can join the server.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be a working bot that has the commands play, pause, and stop.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be a working bot that has all of the commands: play, pause, stop, skip, queue, and list.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps would be first to find out what language I would need to use. I believe using python is doable. After that, I would need to know how to actually create a discord bot and have it join a server. Then, I will research how to work with APIs and the different modules needed for my project. Lastly, to implement my skip, queue, and list commands I would need to know how to implement a queue in python.
